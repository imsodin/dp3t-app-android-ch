## DP3T
The Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T) project is an open protocol for COVID-19 proximity tracing using Bluetooth Low Energy functionality on mobile devices that ensures personal data and computation stays entirely on an individual's phone. It was produced by a core team of over 25 scientists and academic researchers from across Europe. It has also been scrutinized and improved by the wider community.

DP-3T is a free-standing effort started at EPFL and ETHZ that produced this protocol and that is implementing it in an open-sourced app and server.


## Introduction
This is a COVID-19 tracing client using the [DP3T Android SDK](https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-android). It is based on the previously released demo app, but uses the newest version of the SDK. This project will be released as the official COVID-19 tracing solution for Switzerland, therefore UX, messages and flows are optimized for this specific case. Nevertheless, the source code should be a solid foundation to build a similar app for other countries and demostrate how the SDK can be used in a real app.
The app design, UX and implementation was done by [Ubique](https://www.ubique.ch?app=github).

## Further Documentation
The full set of documents for DP3T is at https://github.com/DP-3T/documents. Please refer to the technical documents and whitepapers for a description of the implementation.

A description of the usage of the Google Exposure Notification API can be found [here](https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-android/blob/master/EXPOSURE_NOTIFICATION_API_USAGE.md).

## Installation and Building

The project can be opened with Android Studio 3.6.1 or later or you can build the project with Gradle using
```sh
$ ./gradlew assembleProdRelease
```
The APK is generated under app/build/outputs/apk/prod/release/package-prod-release.apk

The app will not be functional unless your Google account is whitelisted for ExposureNotification testing. Please install the app from the [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.admin.bag.dp3t).

## Reproducible builds

To verify that the app distributed on the PlayStore was built by the source code published here, please see the instructions in [REPRODUCIBLE_BUILDS.md](REPRODUCIBLE_BUILDS.md).
